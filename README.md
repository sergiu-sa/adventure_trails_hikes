# Adventure Trails Hikes

A responsive, accessible HTML/CSS website for a fictional hiking company, built as a semester exam project at Noroff.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates semantic HTML, modular CSS architecture, accessibility best practices, SEO enhancements, and responsive layouts. It was built without any JavaScript or frameworks — just clean HTML and CSS.

> Note: Due to illness from **June 11–18**, the original project plan was reorganized. Despite this, all 6 required HTML pages were built and 4 pages were fully prototyped in Figma. The project remains on track for the final **June 29** deadline.
