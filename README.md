# Adventure Trails Hikes

A responsive, accessible HTML/CSS website for a fictional hiking company, built as a semester exam.

## Project Overview

This project was created for a Noroff Front-End Development semester exam. It demonstrates semantic HTML, modern CSS practices, accessibility, responsive layouts, and performance optimization — all without using frameworks.

## Timeline Note

I was sick from June 11–18, so I had to pause the project during that time. Because of this, I adjusted the timeline and reorganized tasks in GitHub. I designed 4 pages in Figma (which was the minimum required), and I still built all 6 pages in code. Everything is now back on track for the June 29 deadline. You can see the updated plan in the Issues tab.
